# Sequins
Sequins is a monophonic synth sequencer. Its parametres are based on color, hence the name. It runs on HTML, CSS and JS. It uses Tone.js as a main library.

It is comprised of a navbar, a slider section and a pads section. There are 16 pads, and you can change the pitch and note length for each of these with the two first sliders. When you do so, it changes the colors. When you press the play button, it runs through the pads at the set tempo. By pressing a pad, you focus on it, and then you change the parameters. You can disable a pad by pressing the heart button. You can change the source and base type of the oscillator, and set partials. You can change the attack and release.
